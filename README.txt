# Metio

Metio is a simple API to extract TopoWX and Gridmet from the web to a geographic extent and time period.  The data can then be easily saved to a GeoTiff file and used in GIS analysis.

I built this module to be used in Landsat image analysis, so it has functionality that allows one to extract gridded met
data to the same geometry as any Landsat 5, 7, ot 8 image.

The easiest way to get this package is by using `pip`

```
pip install Metio
```
